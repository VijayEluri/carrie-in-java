CARRIE Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------

CARRIE is a framework to create Learning Objects (OA). 
With it you can create OA without concern for the codification of 
following characteristics: 

(A) paging forward and backward; 
(B) Access by the general index; 
(C) Glossary of terms; 
(D) Calculator; 
(E) Virtual Keyboard for more natural input operands an expression; 
(F) Control font size of the text inside the OA; 
(G) Note Pad; 
(H) Save the state of application; 
(I) Access mistakes of the user made previously and long time. 

The CARRIE was built to be a framework for the development of OAs using of Java Applets and
 Java with Swing JFrames.

First, to use this framework it is necessary to add the jar 
carrie.jar in the ClassPath of your application. 

After that, for use with Applets is necessary to extend the
AppletCARRIE class and to use it with JFrames you must
extend the class JFrameCARRIE. 

IMPORTANT: You need to set the title like this "super.init("Fractal Simulator")" in your init() method
		

After that, you can create your own panels and then to add 
them in the CARRIE. 

The settings that will be presented can be used both for 
applets and for the JFrame. But for simplification measure will 
indicated how these settings apply to Applets.
